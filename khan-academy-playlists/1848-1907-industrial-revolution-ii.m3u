CLAUDIO      Death is a fearful thing.  ISABELLA      And shamed life a hateful.  CLAUDIO      Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;     To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;     This sensible warm motion to become     A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit     To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside     In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;     To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,     And blown with restless violence round about     The pendent world; or to be worse than worst     Of those that lawless and incertain thought     Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!     The weariest and most loathed worldly life     That age, ache, penury and imprisonment     Can lay on nature is a paradise     To what we fear of death.  ISABELLA  Alas, alas!

#EXTINF:, Rodin's The Gates of Hell || Auguste Rodin, The Gates of Hell​, 1880-1917, plaster (Musée d'Orsay, Paris)  Speakers: Dr. Beth Harris and Dr. Steven Zucker  When the building, earlier on the site of the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, was destroyed by fire during the Commune in 1871, plans were drawn up to replace it with a museum of decorative arts. Rodin won the competition to design a great set of doors for its entry way. Although the museum was never built, Rodin continued to work on the doors. They became an ongoing project; a grand stage for his sculptural ideas. It's fitting that the plaster of this great unfinished sculpture, The Gates of Hell, is now on display at the d'Orsay, the former railway terminal that was built on this site instead of the museum of decorative arts and that, by lovely coincidence, was converted into one of the world's great art museums.
